            // Ex 1. Create a new Visual C# Console application and name it whatever you wish. Within the Main() function, 
            // write a message to the console by calling the Console.WriteLine() function.

            //Console.WriteLine("Write a message to the console");


            // Ex 2. Declare a string variable and initialize it with the text, "This is one half". 
            // Declare a second string and initialize it with the text "of a sentence." Use the Console.Write()
            // function and your two string variables to write "This is one half of a sentence." to the console.

            //string firstHalf = "This is one half";
            //string secondHalf = " of a sentence.";

            //Console.Write(firstHalf + secondHalf);


            //Ex 3. Declare an int variable named "myInt" and try to initalize it with the following values: 
            // 10, 100, 1000, 10000, etc., adding a zero each time. When you eventually reach a value that is invalid, 
            //read the resulting error message. Determine what different type you can declare that will allow you to store larger integers.

            //int myInt01 = 10;
            //int myInt02 = 100;
            //int myInt03 = 1000;
            //int myInt04 = 10000;
            //int myInt05 = 100000;

            //int myInt08 = 100000000;
            //int myInt09 = 1000000000;
            //long myLong = 10000000000;


            // Ex 4. Declare a float variable named "myFloat" and assign it the value "1.123456789f".
            // Declare a double and assign it the value "1.123456789" (Note that the only difference between these 
            // values is the 'f' at the end of the float value.) Use Console.Writeline() to write each variable to the console. 
            // Compile and execute the program and think about the results; how is a float different from a double? 
            // Keep experimenting with different values to get a feel for how these two types behave.

            //float myFloat01 = 1.123456789f;
            //double mydouble = 1.123456789;

            //Console.WriteLine(myFloat01);
            //Console.WriteLine(mydouble);
