        // Ex. 6. Declare and initialize a new Dictionary<string, int>.Now have your program enter a loop and, each cycle, do the following:
        //    •	Ask the user to enter a person’s first name and store the name in a string (hint: Look up “Console.ReadLine()” to learn how to get user input and assign it to a variable).
        //    •	Check to see if the name exists as a key in the Dictionary.
        //    •	If not, add the name to the Dictionary and map it to an integer value that increases with each name added, starting with 0. For example, the first name added should map to value “0.” The second name added should map to value “1.” You can use a counter to keep track of these values.Have the program write a message to the console indicating that the name was added.
        //   •	If the name entered does exist in the Dictionary, write a message to the console that indicates that the name was found and report back the value associated with that name.
        //   •	Return to the beginning of the loop and continue.
        //    •	Hint: To keep the loop from going on forever, you can provide an escape input: For example, when the program asks the user for a name, if the string entered is “exit”, break the loop and exit the program.
        //     Here’s a brief sample transcript of how the console might look as the program is run.User input is in italics:

           /* Please enter a name:
            Alice
            I’ve added Alice to the Dictionary.
            Please enter a name:
            Bob
            I’ve added Bob to the Dictionary.
            Please enter a name:
            Alice
            Alice exists in the Dictionary with value: 0
            Please enter a name:
            Bob
            Bob exists in the Dictionary with value: 1
            Please enter a name:
            Exit
            Goodbye!*/
